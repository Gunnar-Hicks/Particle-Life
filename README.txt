This project was made for the Processing IDE to simulate the interactions between particles with randomized levels of attraction / repulsion.

HOW TO RUN: Open the ParticleLife.pde file within Processing and update variables to select the number of particle types and total particles.
Click the run button to begin the simulation. Pressing any key will randomize the particle's attributes.
